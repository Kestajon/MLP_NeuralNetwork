This was a simple test to determine how adding more layers to the network affected the result. 

The largest network appeared to produce the top result therefore the results were expanded to test new topologies. An upwards limit for the number of neurones was set from recommendations from source 1, which recommends a maximum limit of 1 neurone for every 10 datapoints. Therefore for the data used, there was a maximum of 120 neurones.

—- Evaluation —-

From all the tests, the seven layer network [3, 6, 7, 4, 5, 2, 1] was found to produce the most accurate result. During producing these results however, the more layers the network has, the longer it takes for the network to train.
